Concurrency:
The script now uses ThreadPoolExecutor to process multiple files simultaneously. Adjust the max_workers value to balance between speed and the load you put on your system and the Google API.

Structure:
Each file is processed in the process_file function. This includes reading, converting, transcribing, and cleaning up the temporary WAV file.

Error Handling:
The code continues to handle errors on a per-file basis so that one file’s failure won’t stop the entire batch.
